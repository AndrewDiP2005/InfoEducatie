The WORDLEarn project is, at base, a Wordle, meant to help people play Wordle more efficiently.

But then, the project expanded to a language learning app.

Software used:

- VSCode, as a code editor
- Python, programming lang
- Colorama, python package

To use this app, open it, open a Wordle website, and follow the on-screen instructions.
